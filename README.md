# SharePoint WSP Repackage

Modifying the files inside of a WSP solution can be tricky if you don't have the Visual Studio project that generated the package.

A WSP package is a simple CAB file and it can be opened with any ZIP tool, but unfortunately most of them do not create cab files.

If you are planning to modify an existent WSP this tool is ideal for you.
